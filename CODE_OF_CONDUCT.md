## Code of Professional Conduct

### Our Commitment

In our ongoing commitment to fostering a professional, inclusive, and respectful environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to create a harassment-free experience for everyone involved in our project and community. This commitment extends to individuals of all backgrounds, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Standards of Behavior

Contributors are expected to adhere to the following standards of behavior to promote a positive environment:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Show respect for differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accept constructive criticism gracefully
* Prioritize the well-being of the community
* Demonstrate empathy towards fellow community members

Unacceptable behavior by participants includes:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for defining and clarifying acceptable behavior standards. They are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to instances of unacceptable behavior. Project maintainers reserve the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that do not align with this Code of Professional Conduct. They may also impose temporary or permanent bans on contributors for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Professional Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representation include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. The specifics of project representation may be further defined by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at protocol@blastblockchain.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is committed to maintaining confidentiality regarding the reporter of an incident. Specific enforcement policies may be detailed separately.

Project maintainers who fail to follow or enforce the Code of Professional Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
